# Data Analysis Project

Welcome to my Data Analyst Portfolio Project! This repository showcases a collection of projects that demonstrate my skills and experience in data analysis. Feel free to explore and provide feedback!

## Project 1: Evolution of Egypt Economy Trends, Challenges, and Stability from 1860 to 2014

In this project, I conducted an analysis using the `african_econ_crises.csv` dataset with Python. I focused on visualizing the trends, challenges, and stability of Egypt's economy over the years using matplotlib.

## Project 2: Super Market Sales

For this project, I started by cleaning the data using Python and formatting each dataset accordingly. Subsequently, I imported the cleaned data into Excel to create a dashboard for visual representation.
